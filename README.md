# Bouldering API

## About

Many Rock Climbers are eager to record what they have achieved in their climbing career or hobby by logging ascents of particular problems and historic routes.

This is done to not only measure their success over time, but also demonstrate their skillset. Its also acts as a way to communicate certain nuances of a particular climb and its perceived grading or difficulty to other members of the climbing community.

Many climbing routes are located in undiscovered areas and are completely unknown until someone decides to observe whether there is an achieveable route to the top of the rockface or boulder, in which a climber may either ascend it themselves or document it as a route to be climbed. Historically the first ascensionist gets to name the route.

The problem is, there isn't many ways for climbers to log their ascents of routes, discuss and find exact locations of the routes and the rock type, grade the level of difficulty, talk about particular nuances to achieve the climb and provide information on area ethics, hazards and changes to the area.

## Aim

The aim of this application is solve the aforementioned issues by providing a means for climbers to log their ascents, including grading the difficulty, methods of achieving it through descriptions, send type, and discussing changes that may be present.

This is implemented through the use of an API Web Application that utilises a database to store information of known routes that have been documented, store users information and their ascents, as well as giving users the ability to access known routes and add their own to the database.

Users information is protection through the use of authentication and authorisation methods.

The database is protected and managed by members of the climbing community with administration rights.
